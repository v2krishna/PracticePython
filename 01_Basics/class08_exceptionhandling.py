Exception Handling
==================
Error -- when it occurs at compile time.
Exception -- occurs at run-time

try      -->  we write suspicious code within this statements or clause
except   -->  this block executes only if there's exception occured in try block, single try block may have multiple except clauses
              we can use except clause to handle individual or multiple exceptions at a time.
else    -->   This block exceutes only if there's no exception occured in try block,
              we can use only single else block per try block
finally -->   This block executes anyhow that is may or may not error occured, it executes
raise   -->   This statement raises an exception which can be handled by except clause.
